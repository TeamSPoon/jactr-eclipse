  <h1>Scripted Productions</h1>
  <p>
 Sometimes we just have to break the separation of model and task. For these moments we have customization.
 There are two types of customization: scripting (Javascript currently, more in the future), and actually
 writing and compiling java code.
</p>
<p>
Why use one over the other? Scripting should be used for simple, one-time operations. Scripts are embedded
in the model itself - so they are just as editable as the rest of the model. Compiled Java code is for more complex
or frequently used operations. You can't modify their behavior much at runtime.
</p>
<p>
!eval! in the Lisp version is equivalent to the scripting. One difference, however, is that the semantics
are different for the right-hand and left-hand sides of the production. This differentiation extends to
the compiled Java code as well.
</p>

<h2>Conditions</h2>
<p>Along with the &lt match tag, there is the &lt scriptable-condition &gt tag. 
<pre>
 &lt;scriptable-condition&gt &lt;![CDATA[
 function match(chunk, bindings)
 {
  //bindings is a Map containing variable/value pairs
  //return true or false, if false, the production will fail to instantiate
  //for example.. 
  var runtime = jactr.getRuntime();
  //with the runtime, we can get the application data
  var myExperiment = runtime.getApplicationData();
  //lets say myExperiment has a method .isReady() which returns true if
  // the experiment is ready to continue (think spinning cursor delay)
  // if this returns myExperiment.isReady(), it will only be viable
  // for conflict resolution if the experiment is ready to go

  return myExperiment.isReady();
 }
 ]]!&lt;/scriptable-condition&gt
</pre>
</p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<p>
Scriptable actions follow an identical logic.
<pre>
 &lt;scriptable-action&gt &lt;![CDATA[
 function fire(model, instantiation, bindings)
 {
  //now we get the model, the production instantiation, and the variable bindings
  //let's imagine myExperiment has .checkOption(int) where int is the choice option
  // that the subject would respond with..
  // and the option we'd use is bound to the variable =optionValue
  var myExperiment = jactr.getRuntime().getApplicationData();
  
  var choiceOption = bindings.get("=optionValue");
  myExperiment.checkOption(choiceOption);
  return 0.0;
 }
 ]]!&lt;/scriptable-action&gt
</pre>
</p>
<h3>Common Funtions</h3>
<p>The scripting is provided by the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/">Rhino</a> project from <a href="http://mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a>. This
site has excellent documentation on scripting. To make things easier, the scriptable code has access to a <i>jactr</i> object. It includes:
<ul>
 <li>defineGlobal(String, Object) : adds the object to the global scripting context. jactr is actually installed into
   the scripting environment with this call. </li>
 <li>bind(Map, String, Object) : insert object into the bindings with the name. These bindings will hold true for the duration of the production's execution</li>
 <li>getRuntime() : returns the ACTRRuntime</li>
 <li>getSlotValue(Chunk, String) : return the value contained in the named slot of chunk</li>
 <li>setSlotValue(Chunk, String, Object) : set the named slot of chunk to object</li>
 <li>output(Model, String, Map) : output a template string to the model output trace and try to resolve variables from the map
</ul>
<h2>Compiled Code</h2>  
<p>
 If you want faster execution and don't require constant tweaking of the custom code, compiling the appropriate custom code is probably best.
 Custom conditions must extend org.jactr.core.production.condition.Condition, actions must extends org.jactr.core.production.action.Action. However,
 for customs it's best to work from org.jactr.core.production.condition.Pattern and org.jactr.core.production.action.DefaultAction.
</p>
<p>
 To make the code accessible to models, you can use the proxy tags: &lt;proxy-action & &lt;proxy-condition, both 
 of which task the <i>class=</i> attribute specifying the full class name of the custom code class.
