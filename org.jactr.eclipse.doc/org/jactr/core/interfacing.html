  <h1>Interfacing Experiments</h1>
  <p>
  Part of interfacing experiments with models almost inevitably requires there to be custom
  launching code to get to two running and configured. In a continuous attempt to completely 
  separate the model from the task, interfacing models is done through the environment configuration.
  </p>
  <p>
  The ACTRRuntime has support for executing custom code after the reality interface has been
  configured but before the models actually start running. It also supports the execution of code
  after all the models have finished running (either normally or in error) but before the reality
  interface has been destroyed.
  </p>
  <h2><a name="onstart">onStart & onStop</a></h2>
  <p>
  The onStart and onStop code hooks are instances of the java.lang.Runnable interface. In the case
  of the environment configuration file, the tags &lt onStart class="class.name" / &gt accepts the class
  name of the relevant code.
  <br><br>
  <b>Programmatically:</b>
  <pre>
   ...
   ...
   Runnable onStart = new Runnable(){
     public void run()
     {
      //Print the names of the models
      Collection models = ACTRRuntime.getDefaultRuntime().getModels();
      Iterator itr = models.iterator();
      while(itr.hasNext())
       System.err.println( (Model)itr.next());
     
      //let's launch some imaginary experiment
      Experiment myExp = new Experiment();
      // let's pretend myExp.run() will open a window and start and experiment
      // (if it doesn't use its own thread, you should provide it one..)
      myExp.run();
      //the models <b>WILL not</b> start util this method returns
     }
   };
   ..
   ACTRRuntime.getDefaultRuntime().setOnStart(onStart);
   ..
   .
  </pre>
  </p>
  
<h2>Application Data</h2>
 <p>
 Often times we may need to make some application (experiment) data available through out
 the entire run. Say for instance that you're interfacing the model to the experiment, but
 not through the reality interface (providing handles to manipulate the keyboard/mouse). You'd 
 need productions that "click" etc. To do this, you'll need acccess to the experiment instance.
 </p> 
 <pre>
 ...
   ...
   //we move the instantiation of the experiment up
   // and make it final so that the onStart code
   // can access it
   final Experiment myExperiment = new Experiment();
   
   Runnable onStart = new Runnable(){
     public void run()
     {
      myExperiment.run();
      //the models <b>WILL not</b> start util this method returns
     }
   };
   
   ACTRRuntime runtime = ACTRRuntime.getDefaultRuntime();
   runtime.setOnStart(onStart);
   //this will now be accessible anywhere in the model.. 
   // in particular in <a href="scripting.html">scripted productions</a> (see the next section)
   runtime.setApplicationData(myExperiment);
   ..
