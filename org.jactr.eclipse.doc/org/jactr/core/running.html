 <h1>Running Models</h1>
 <p>
JACT-R has been designed from the ground up with the ability to run multiple models concurrently, allowing them to interact with no difficulty. This functionality comes at the cost of increased complexity for the controlling of model execution. The added complexity includes configuring how the models interface the “real” world, time control, and pre/post run execution options. One can go about this from the command line or programmatically.
</p>

<h2>Command line</h2>
<p>
JACT-R’s default program entry point is the org.jactr.jactr class. This class takes three parameters, one of which is optional. 
</p>
<pre align="center">
java -cp {classpath-entries} org.jactr.jactr -e environmentFile.env -r
or
java -cp {classpath-entries} org.jactr.jactr --environment environmentFile.env --run
</pre>
<p>
The environmentFile is an XML configuration file that specifies real world interaction. It is detailed more fully in <a href="reality.html">reality configuration documentation</a>. The run option will do just that. The default behavior is to just load up the models and configure the environment. 
</p>


<h2>Programmatic Control</h2>
<p>
Programmatic control of models requires two classes: org.jactr.runtime.ACTRRuntime and org.jactr.runtime.DefaultController. The following code snippet hightlights the process.
</p>
<pre>
public void runModels(Model[] models)  //Note: 1
{
  <a href="">ACTRRuntime</a> runtime = ACTRRuntime.newRuntime(); // Note: 2
  ACTRRuntime.setDefaultRuntime(runtime); //Note: 3
  for(int i=0;i &lt; models.length;i++)
    runtime.addModel(models[i]);  //Note: 4
  
 DefaultController controller = new DefaultController(runtime); //Note: 5
 runtime.setController(controller);
 controller.run(); //Note: 6
 controller.waitForCompletion(); //Note: 7
}
</pre>

<ol>
<li>We are assuming that the models have already been created either programmatically or by loading. See the <a href="loading.html">Loading Models </a>documentation for details on that process.
<li>You should explicitly create a new runtime. A default runtime may already exist from previous model executions. This ensures that this runtime is a clean slate.
<li>Setting the default runtime allows all subsequent runtime calls (on this thread) to utilize the new one. 
<li>Each model that you want to run must be added to the runtime. A model can only ever be associated with a single runtime. Querying the runtime now with runtime.getModels() will return a collection of all the models. Runtime.getRunningModels() will return an empty list since the models have not been started yet.
<li>The runtime must be controlled by a secondary object: org.jactr.core.runtime.Controller. This provides a level of abstraction and better control. The DefaultController just allows you to reset, start, stop, suspend and resume model execution. The DebugController provides even more advanced control
<li>The Controller provides basic methods: run(), stop(), suspend(), resume(), and reset(). Which do just about what they claim to. However, these are asynchronous commands. Models that are already running will stop, suspend, or resume as soon as they can given their current execution state.
<li>The method waitForCompletion() allows you to block the current thread until all of the models have ceased running either normally or by exception. After this method returns, runtime.getTerminatedModels() will contain all the models.
</ol>
